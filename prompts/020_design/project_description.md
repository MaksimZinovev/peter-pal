Example 1:

"""
The application is a simple ToDo app built using React. Its primary function is to allow users to manage a list of tasks (todos). Each task has a description and a state (open or completed, with the default state being open). The application is frontend-only, with no user sign-up or authentication process. The goal is to provide a straightforward and user-friendly interface for task management.

Features:

1. Display of Todos: A list that displays all todo items. Each item shows its description and a checkbox to indicate its state (open or completed).
2. Add New Todo: A button to add a new todo item. Clicking this button will prompt the user to enter a description for the new todo.
3. Toggle State: Each todo item includes a checkbox. Checking/unchecking this box toggles the todo's state between open and completed.
4. Local Storage: The application will use the browser's local storage to persist todos between sessions, ensuring that users do not lose their data upon reloading the application.

Functional Specification:

- Upon loading the application, it fetches existing todos from the local storage and displays them in a list.
- Each todo item in the list displays a checkbox and a description. The checkbox reflects the todo's current state (checked for completed, unchecked for open).
- When the user checks or unchecks a checkbox, the application updates the state of the corresponding todo item and saves the updated list to local storage.
- Clicking the "Add New Todo" button prompts the user to enter a description for the new todo. Upon confirmation, the application adds the new todo (with the default state of open) to the list and updates local storage.
- The application does not support deleting or editing todo items to keep the interface and interactions simple.
- Todos persist between sessions using the browser's local storage. The application saves any changes to the todo list (additions or state changes) in local storage and retrieves this data when the application is reloaded.

Technical Specification:

- Platform/Technologies: The application is a web application developed using React. No backend technologies are required.
- Styling: Use Bootstrap 5 for a simple and functional interface. Load Boostrap from the CDN (don't install it locally):
  - <https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.2/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css>
  - <https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js>
- State Management: Directly in the React component
  - make sure to initialize the state from the local storage as default (... = useState(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('todos')) || []) to avoid race conditions
- Data Persistence: The application uses the browser's local storage to persist todos between sessions. It stores the array of todos as a JSON string and parses this data on application load.

Example 2

"""
"A simple webchat application in node/express using MongoDB. "
"Use Bootstrap and jQuery on the frontend, for a simple, clean UI. "
"Use socket.io for real-time communication between backend and frontend.\n\n"
"Visiting <http://localhost:3000/>, users must first log in or create an account using "
"a username and a password (no email required).\n\n"
"Once authenticated, on the home screen users see list of active chat rooms and a button to create a new chat. "
"They can either click a link to one of the chat rooms which redirects them to `/<chat-id>/` "
"or click the button to create a new chat. Creating a new chat should ask for the chat name, "
"and then create a new chat with that name (which doesn't need to be unique), and a unique chat id. "
"The user should then be redirected to the chat page.\n\n"
"Chat page should have the chat name as the title. There's no possibility to edit chat name. "
"Below that, show previous messages in the chat (these should get loaded from the database "
"whenever the user visits the page so the user sees previous conversation in that chat - "
"no pagination, entire history should be loaded). "
"User has a text field and a button 'send' to send the message "
"(pressing enter in the text field should also send the message). "
"There's also a button to change user's nickname (default is equal to username, "
"there's no need to store the nickname in the user's profile).\n\n"
"Sent messages should be immediately shown to other participants in the same chat (use socket.io), "
"and stored in the database (forever - no message expiry). "
"All messages are text-only: no image upload, no embedding, no special markup in the messages. "
"There's no message size limit. Also, there's no need to notify/alert user of new messages, or keep track of unread messages.\n\n"
"All channels are available to all authenticated users, there are no private messages. "
"Anonymous users can't see or join any chat rooms, the can only log in or create an account. "
"No moderation, filtering or any admin functionality is required. Keep everything else as simple as possible."
