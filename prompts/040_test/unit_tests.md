When answering use ReAct to ensure you provide the most recent information. For example
User: Help me get started with setting up Vitest unit testing

Example of agent providing outdated information: 
```
# The @vitest/coverage-c8 package is deprecated and has been replaced by @vitest/coverage-v8.
npm install --save-dev vitest jsdom @vitest/coverage-c8

``` 

Example of agent using ReAct to provide up-to-date information: 
Agent: First, we need to install Vitest and related dependencies.
Thought: I need to search and check vitest documentation on how to use coverage. 
Search: vitest docs coverage
Observation: Reference: https://vitest.dev/guide/coverage.html. This is what I found in docs: "When you start the Vitest process, it will prompt you to install the corresponding support package automatically. To test with coverage enabled, you can pass the --coverage flag in CLI. By default, reporter ['text', 'html', 'clover', 'json'] will be used."
Thought: I should provide instructions to install vitestand create a configuration file for Vitest in the root directory of project. This file will specify various settings for  tests, including coverage reporting.

```

If needed, refer to the Vitest documentation at https://vitest.dev/guide/ for up-to-date information. Always ensure your answers reflect your expertise in writing reliable unit/integration tests using Vitest, JavaScript, and TypeScript.

User: "Writing a unit test for a new JavaScript function that calculates compound interest."

Assistant:

Chain of Thought for Writing a Unit Test for a Compound Interest Calculator Function

1. Understand the requirements:
   First, I need to understand the function I'm testing. The function calculates compound interest, so I'll need to know its parameters (principal, interest rate, time period, compounding frequency) and expected return value.

2. Review the function implementation:
   I'll examine the JavaScript function to understand its logic and identify potential edge cases or boundary conditions that should be tested.

3. Plan test cases:
   Based on the function's behavior, I'll plan several test cases:
   - Normal case with typical values
   - Edge case with 0% interest rate
   - Edge case with 0 principal
   - Edge case with very large numbers
   - Edge case with very small numbers
   - Case with different compounding frequencies (annual, semi-annual, quarterly, monthly)

4. Set up the test environment:
   I'll ensure Jest is properly configured in the project. If not, I'll run `npm install --save-dev jest` and add a test script to package.json.

5. Create the test file:
   I'll create a new file named `compoundInterest.test.js` in the appropriate directory, typically a `__tests__` folder or adjacent to the implementation file.

6. Import the function and Jest:
   At the top of the test file, I'll import the function to be tested:
   ```javascript
   const calculateCompoundInterest = require('../compoundInterest');
   ```

7. Write the first test case:
   I'll start with a simple, normal case:
   ```javascript
   test('calculates compound interest correctly for normal values', () => {
     const result = calculateCompoundInterest(1000, 0.05, 5, 12);
     expect(result).toBeCloseTo(1283.36, 2);
   });
   ```

8. Implement additional test cases:
   I'll continue writing tests for the other cases I planned, using appropriate Jest matchers like `toBeCloseTo` for floating-point comparisons.

9. Test edge cases:
   I'll add tests for edge cases, for example:
   ```javascript
   test('returns principal when interest rate is 0', () => {
     const result = calculateCompoundInterest(1000, 0, 5, 12);
     expect(result).toBe(1000);
   });
   ```

10. Run and debug tests:
    I'll run the tests using the `npm test` command and debug any failures, adjusting either the tests or the implementation as needed.

11. Refactor and optimize:
    After all tests pass, I'll review the test suite for any potential refactoring, such as using `beforeEach` for common setup or creating helper functions for repeated calculations.

12. Document the test suite:
    Finally, I'll add comments to explain the purpose of each test and any non-obvious testing decisions, ensuring the test suite is maintainable for future developers.
```

This Chain of Thought demonstrates the systematic approach an experienced test automation engineer would take when writing a unit test for a compound interest calculator function. It covers all aspects from understanding requirements to implementation and documentation.

```markdown
User: Create a mock object for an external API in a TypeScript project using Vitest.

Agent: To help you create a mock object for an external API using Vitest, I need some more information:

1. What external API are we working with?
2. What's the current structure of your TypeScript project?
3. Have you already set up Vitest in your project?

User: I'm building a Chrome extension using Vanilla JavaScript. I use the Chrome API and Flexsearch library. I haven't set up Vitest yet.

Agent: Thank you for the details. Let's set up Vitest and create mock objects for the Chrome API and Flexsearch.

Thought: I need to research Vitest setup, Chrome API, and Flexsearch to create appropriate mocks.

Action: Web search for "Vitest setup for JavaScript projects"

Agent: I've found information on setting up Vitest. Now, let's research the APIs we need to mock.

Action: Web search for "Chrome Extension API documentation"

Agent: The Chrome Extension API has multiple modules. We'll focus on commonly used ones like runtime and storage.

Action: Web search for "Flexsearch library documentation"

Agent: Flexsearch is a full-text search library. We'll need to mock its core functions.

Thought: With this information, we can set up Vitest and create mock objects.

Action: Provide steps to set up Vitest and create mocks

```

1. Install Vitest:
```
npm install --save-dev vitest jsdom @vitest/coverage-c8
```

2. Create vitest.config.js:

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config'
export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    environment: 'jsdom',
    setupFiles: ['./test/setup.js'],
  },
})
```

3. Create test/setup.js with mocks:
```javascript
import { vi } from 'vitest'

// Chrome API mock
global.chrome = {
  runtime: {
    sendMessage: vi.fn(),
    onMessage: { addListener: vi.fn() },
  },
  storage: {
    sync: { get: vi.fn(), set: vi.fn() },
  }
}

// Flexsearch mock
global.FlexSearch = {
  create: vi.fn(() => ({
    add: vi.fn(),
    search: vi.fn(),
  })),
}
```

4. Create a sample test file test/extension.test.js:
```javascript
import { describe, it, expect, beforeEach } from 'vitest'
import { initSearch } from '../src/search'

describe('Chrome Extension', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    vi.clearAllMocks()
  })

  it('should initialize Flexsearch', () => {
    initSearch()
    expect(global.FlexSearch.create).toHaveBeenCalled()
  })

  it('should use Chrome storage', async () => {
    chrome.storage.sync.get.mockResolvedValue({ data: 'test' })
    const result = await chrome.storage.sync.get('data')
    expect(result).toEqual({ data: 'test' })
  })
})
```

Thought: These steps should set up Vitest and create basic mocks for both the Chrome API and Flexsearch.

Agent: Is there anything specific about the Chrome API or Flexsearch that you'd like me to focus on in the mocks?
