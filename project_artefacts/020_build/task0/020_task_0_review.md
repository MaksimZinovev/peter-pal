Recommendations for improvement:

Update to Manifest V3:

Change "manifest_version" to 3
Replace "browser_action" with "action"
Move "background" script to "service_worker"
Update permissions if necessary (some might have changed in V3)
Enhance webpack configuration:

Add plugins for optimization (e.g., TerserPlugin for minification)
Include CSS loaders (e.g., style-loader, css-loader)
Consider adding source maps for development
Update package.json:

Use exact versions or range versions for dependencies
Add scripts for development and production builds
Implement error handling:

Add try-catch blocks in background and content scripts
Implement logging for errors
Consider adding ESLint for code quality:

Install ESLint and create a .eslintrc.js file
Add lint script to package.json
These improvements will enhance the project structure, maintainability, and adherence to best practices for Chrome extension development.
