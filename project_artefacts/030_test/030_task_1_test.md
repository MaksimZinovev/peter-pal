### Step 1

Result: pass
Action: Install the Chrome extension in developer mode
Expected result: The extension should be successfully installed in Chrome

### Step 2

Result: Pass
Action: 
On the chrome://extensions page, find your extension
Click on the "background page" link under your extension
This will open DevTools for your background script
Check the console for any error messages

### Step 3

Result: pass
Action: Press the keyboard shortcut Opt+Shift+I on any web page
Expected result: The command palette should appear on the page. If it doesn't, check the console for any error messages related to sending or receiving messages

### Step 4

Result: pass
Action: Open the Chrome Extensions page (chrome://extensions/), find your extension, and click on "Inspect views: background page"
Expected result: A new Developer Tools window should open for the background page

### Step 5

Result: pass
Action: In the background page's console, type the following command:
```javascript
chrome.storage.sync.get('theme', console.log)
```
Expected result: You should see an object with the 'theme' property set to 'dark' (e.g., `{theme: "dark"}`)

### Step 6
Action: Close and reopen Chrome, then repeat Step 5
Expected result: You should still see the same theme setting, confirming that the theme persistence is working correctly

These steps will help you verify that the background script has been implemented correctly, including the keyboard shortcut functionality, message passing, and theme persistence. If any step fails or produces unexpected results, there may be issues with the implementation that need to be addressed.
