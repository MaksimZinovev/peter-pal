Thank you for providing the code and task requirements. I'll now create a step-by-step list of actions for testing the implementation of the command palette UI component. Let's focus on the most important functional and visual aspects of the task.

### Step 1
result: Pass

Action: Open a web page in Google Chrome (e.g., https://www.example.com)
Expected result: The web page should load normally without any visible changes from the extension.

### Step 2
result: Pass

Action: Press the keyboard shortcut Alt+F
Expected result: The command palette should appear as an overlay on the web page. It should have a semi-transparent background, be centered on the page, and contain a search input field, help text, and an empty results list.

### Step 3
Action: Observe the appearance of the command palette
Expected result: The command palette should have a dark theme by default, with a dark background for the palette container, light text, and styling consistent with the provided CSS in theme-dark.css.

### Step 4
result: Pass

Action: Press the Escape key
Expected result: The command palette should close and disappear from the screen.

### Step 5
Action: Reopen the command palette with Alt+F, then click outside the palette area
Expected result: The command palette should remain open. It should only close when the Escape key is pressed.

### Step 6
Action: Implement a temporary button to toggle the theme (as the theme toggle functionality is not fully implemented in the provided code), then click it to switch to the light theme
Expected result: The command palette's appearance should change to match the light theme defined in theme-light.css. The background should become light-colored, and text should become dark.

These steps cover the main functional aspects of the command palette UI component, including its appearance, toggling, theme switching, and basic interaction. They verify that the most critical parts of the task have been implemented correctly.
