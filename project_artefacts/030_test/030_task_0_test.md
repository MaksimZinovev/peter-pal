### Step 5

Result: pass
Action: Check the manifest.json file by running:
```
cat manifest.json
```
Expected result: The content should match the provided manifest.json in the code, including the correct permissions, background script, content script, and commands.

### Step 6

Result: pass
Action: Verify the content of the background script by running:
```
cat src/background.js

```
cat .eslintrc.js
```
Expected result: You should see the ESLint configuration as provided in the code.

### Step 10

Result: pass
Action: Verify that the initial build was successful by checking the dist directory:
```
ls dist
```
Expected result: You should see at least two files: background.bundle.js and content.bundle.js

### Step 11

Result: pass
Action: Try running the linter to ensure it's set up correctly:
```
npm run lint

4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the project directory

Expected result: The extension should load without errors, and you should see it listed on the extensions page with the name "Peter Pal" and the description you provided.

These steps should help verify that the project structure has been set up correctly, all dependencies are installed, and the basic configuration files are in place as per the task requirements.
