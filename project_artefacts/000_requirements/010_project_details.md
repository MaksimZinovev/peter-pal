## PROJECT DETAILS 

Here is a project description for a Chrome extension for Quick Fieldsing on web pages:

The project is a powerful Chrome extension that enables effortless, user-friendly, keyboard-focused search on web pages, allowing quick search of elements by text and highlighting them for improved visibility. The extension aims to streamline navigation and enhance productivity for users interacting with content-heavy web pages.

Features:
1. Command Palette Interface: An intuitive keyboard-driven interface using a command palette for efficient text-based searches.
2. Fuzzy Text Search: Super-fast fuzzy search capability that matches elements based on their textual content, even with partial or misspelled queries.
3. Dynamic Highlighting: Selected search results are instantly highlighted on the web page with dynamic visual effects, making it easier for users to spot the targeted elements amid a large number of fields and components.


Functional Specification:
- Upon activating the search with a hotkey, a command palette overlay appears, allowing users to enter search queries using their keyboard.
- As users type, the extension performs a fuzzy search on the textual content of all elements on the current web page, displaying relevant matches in real-time.
- When a search result is selected, the corresponding element on the web page is dynamically highlighted with a visually distinct effect, such as a pulsating border or a temporarily modified background color.
- Users can navigate between search results using keyboard shortcuts, with the highlighted element updating accordingly on the page.
- The extension provides customization options for highlighting styles, keyboard shortcuts, and other preferences to suit individual user needs.
- The search functionality works seamlessly across various web page structures and element types, ensuring a consistent user experience.

Technical Specification:
- Platform: Google Chrome browser extension, compatible with the latest version of Chrome.
- Technologies: JavaScript, Chrome Extension APIs (e.g., content scripts, messaging, storage), and any additional libraries or frameworks required for efficient text search and DOM manipulation.
- Integration: The extension should integrate seamlessly with the Chrome browser, leveraging its extension APIs and following best practices for performance and security.
- User Interface: A clean and intuitive command palette interface for search input, with keyboard accessibility as a priority.
- Extensibility: The extension should be designed with extensibility in mind, allowing for future enhancements such as custom search filters, integration with external services, or support for additional browsers.
