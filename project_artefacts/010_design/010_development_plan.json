Install the required dependencies (Flexsearch, Mousetrap, and Bootstrap) using npm. Set up a basic webpack configuration to bundle these dependencies with the extension. Create the initial manifest.json file with necessary permissions and content script declarations. Set up the directory structure for background scripts, content scripts, and UI components. This task establishes the foundational structure and dependency management for the Chrome extension.",

Implement the logic to handle the 'Alt+F' keyboard shortcut using the chrome.commands API. When the shortcut is triggered, send a message to the active tab's content script to show the command palette. This script will serve as the central coordinator for extension activities and handle cross-component communication.",

Include areas for the search input, help text, and result suggestions. Create corresponding CSS files for both light and dark themes, ensuring the palette has a semi-transparent background and is centered on the page. Use Bootstrap for responsive design and basic styling. Implement JavaScript functionality to toggle between light and dark themes. This task focuses on creating a visually appealing and functional UI component.",

Implement logic to inject the command palette HTML into the page when receiving the activation message from the background script. Use Mousetrap to handle keyboard interactions within the command palette (e.g., navigation, closing). Implement functionality to focus the search input automatically when the palette is opened. Add event listeners for closing the palette when clicking outside or pressing Escape. This script will handle the direct interaction between the extension and the web page.",

Initialize Flexsearch with this data when the command palette is activated. As the user types in the search input, use Flexsearch to perform real-time fuzzy searching and update the displayed results in the command palette. Implement debouncing to optimize performance during typing. This task sets up the core search functionality of the extension.",

Create functions to render search results in the command palette UI, similar to the example image with icons, titles, and categories. Implement keyboard navigation (up/down arrows) to move through results, updating the UI to show the currently selected item. Add functionality to perform actions when a result is selected (e.g., by pressing Enter). This task completes the user interaction flow within the command palette.",

Create a data structure to store help text and hotkey information for different states of the palette (e.g., initial state, search state, result navigation). Update this information dynamically as the user interacts with the palette. This task enhances the user experience by providing clear guidance and hotkey information.",

Verify that the 'Alt+F' hotkey consistently activates the command palette. Ensure smooth performance of the fuzzy search, even on pages with many elements. Test theme switching and persistence. Verify keyboard navigation and selection within the command palette. Fix any bugs or issues discovered during testing. This task ensures the reliability and robustness of the extension.",
