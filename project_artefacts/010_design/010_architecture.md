1. Architecture:
   - A content script injected into web pages to interact with the DOM and perform searches/highlighting.
   - A background script to handle extension events, messaging, and user preferences.
   - A custom command palette overlay for the keyboard-driven search interface.
   - Integration with a fuzzy text search library  flexsearch for efficient matching.
   - Direct manipulation of element styles and CSS animations/transitions for dynamic highlighting.
   - Local storage using the chrome.storage API for persisting user settings and configurations.

2. The only system dependency required is the latest version of Google Chrome, as the extension will run within the Chrome browser environment.

3. For package dependencies:
   - flexsearch search library for efficient text matching.
   - mousetrap for handling keyboard shortcuts and hotkeys within the extension.
   - Bootstrap for styling the command palette overlay and providing a responsive UI.
