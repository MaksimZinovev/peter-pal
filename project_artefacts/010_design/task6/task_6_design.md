Recommended Solution: Enhanced Array-based Navigation with CSS Highlighting and Smooth Scrolling

This solution combines the simplicity of array-based navigation with CSS-based highlighting and the native Smooth Scrolling API. It builds upon the existing code structure and utilizes browser APIs for better performance.

Reasoning:
1. Compatibility with existing code: The current implementation already uses an array-like structure (searchIndex) to store and manage search results. We can easily extend this to handle navigation.

2. Performance: Using CSS for highlighting and the native Smooth Scrolling API will be more performant than implementing custom JavaScript solutions for these features.

3. Simplicity: This approach requires minimal changes to the existing codebase, making it easier to implement and maintain.

4. Browser support: Modern browsers support smooth scrolling, and we can easily add fallbacks for older browsers if needed.

Implementation outline:
1. Extend the `searchManager.js` to keep track of the currently selected item index.
2. Modify the `displayResults` function to add CSS classes for highlighting the selected item.
3. Implement keyboard navigation (up/down arrows) in `commandPalette.js`.
4. Add an event listener for the Enter key to trigger scrolling and highlighting.
5. Use `element.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth', block: 'center' })` for scrolling.

This solution aligns well with the existing code structure, utilizes browser capabilities for better performance, and provides a straightforward implementation path. It addresses the requirements for navigation, highlighting, and scrolling without introducing unnecessary complexity or dependencies.
