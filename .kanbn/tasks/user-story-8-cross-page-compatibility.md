# User Story 8 Cross-page Compatibility

User Story 8:
As a user, I want the Quick Fields extension to work consistently across different websites, so that I can rely on it regardless of the web page structure.

Acceptance Criteria:
- The extension functions on various website layouts and designs
- The search and highlight features work with dynamically loaded content
- The extension doesn't interfere with the normal functioning of websites
