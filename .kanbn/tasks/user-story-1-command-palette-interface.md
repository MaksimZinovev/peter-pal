# User Story 1  Command Palette Interface

As a user, I want to activate a command palette interface using a hotkey, so that I can quickly start searching for elements on a web page without using my mouse.

Acceptance Criteria:
- A hotkey (e.g., Alt+F) activates the command palette overlay
- The command palette appears in the middle of the current web page
- The command palette is keyboard-accessible
- The user's cursor is automatically focused in the search input field
