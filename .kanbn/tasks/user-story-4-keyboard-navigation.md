# User Story 4 Keyboard navigation

User Story 4:
As a user, I want to be able to select search result item and navigate to move through results in the command palette using(up/down arrows), updating the UI to show the currently selected item.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Pressing up/down keyboard arrows selects previous/next search result
- Selecting the item in search results updates the UI to show the currently selected item in command pallette visually distinct (e.g.,  changed background, text color)
- Typing additional characters into search field moves selection to the first item from the top (if there are any search results matching) or "No items available".

User tasks: 
1. User has the command palette open with search results displayed
2. User presses the up or down arrow keys to navigate through the list of search results
3. User observes that the currently selected search result item is visually highlighted or distinguished in the command palette UI
