# User Story 8 Performance

User Story 8:
As a user, I want the Quick Fields extension to perform searches quickly and efficiently, so that it doesn't slow down my browsing experience.

Acceptance Criteria:
- The command palette appears within 500ms of activating the hotkey
- Search results update within 100ms of typing
- The extension doesn't noticeably impact the loading time or performance of web pages
