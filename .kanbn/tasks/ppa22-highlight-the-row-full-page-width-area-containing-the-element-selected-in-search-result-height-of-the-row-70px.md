# ppa22 Highlight the row. Full-page width area containing the element selected in search result. Height of the row 70px

Highlighting improvements: Highlight the row: full-page width area containing the element. Height of the row 70px


**User Story:**
As a user, I want the row containing the selected search result element to be highlighted with a full-page width rectangle with a solid white shade color, making it easier for me to find the selected element on the page.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. When a user selects a search result and presses the hotkey to scroll into view, the row containing the selected element is highlighted with a full-page width rectangle.
2. The highlighted rectangle has a solid white shade color.
3. The height of the highlighted rectangle is 70px.
4. The highlighted rectangle is displayed on top of the page content, without overlapping or hiding any other elements.
5. The highlighting is removed when the user selects another search result or closes the command palette.

**User Tasks:**

1. Update the `highlightElement` function in `src/commandPalette.js` to create a full-page width rectangle with a solid white shade color instead of using an outline.
2. Adjust the height of the highlighted rectangle to 70px.
3. Ensure that the highlighted rectangle is displayed on top of the page content without overlapping or hiding any other elements.
4. Add a new CSS class to `src/themeManager.js` to style the highlighted rectangle with a solid white shade color.
5. Update the `toggleTheme` function in `src/themeManager.js` to apply the new CSS class when the theme is changed.
6. Test the feature enhancement to ensure it meets the acceptance criteria.

To learn more about the implementation details, you may want to explore the following:

* `src/commandPalette.js`: Review the `highlightElement` function to understand how the current highlighting is implemented.
* `src/themeManager.js`: Examine the `toggleTheme` function to see how the theme is applied and how the new CSS class can be integrated.
* `src/uiComponents.js`: Check if there are any existing UI components that can be reused or modified to create the highlighted rectangle.
* `000_features_list.md`: Review the features list to ensure that this enhancement aligns with the overall project goals and requirements.
* `project_description.md`: Refer to the project description to understand the context and objectives of the project.
