Story 1: Automatically focus on palette input field when palette is triggered
Status: Done

User Story:
As a user, 
I want the command palette input field to be automatically focused when I trigger the palette, so that I can immediately start typing my search query without having to manually focus the input field.

Acceptance Criteria:
- When the command palette is triggered (e.g., via a hotkey), the input field is immediately focused and ready for text input.
- The user can start typing the search query right away without having to click or tab into the input field.
- If the user triggers the palette again while it's already open, the input field remains focused.

User Tasks:
1. User triggers the command palette (e.g., by pressing a hotkey combination).
2. User observes that the input field in the command palette is automatically focused and ready for text input.
3. User starts typing a search query without having to manually focus the input field.

Story 2: Automatically select first result in search results list when user starts typing

User Story:
As a user, 
I want the first search result matching my query to be automatically selected in the results list of the command palette 
so that I do not need to navigate to the first result by pressing "Down" 
and can quickly perform next action  without extra steps.

Acceptance Criteria:
- If the user starts typing a search query immediately after triggering the palette, the first result in the search results list is automatically selected.
- If no search results match the query, no item is selected, and the "No elements found" message is displayed.
- If the user clears the search query, the initial list of items is displayed, and first item is selected.
- Keyboard navigation (e.g., up/down arrows) works as expected, allowing the user to move through the search results.

User Tasks:
1. User triggers the command palette (e.g., by pressing a hotkey combination).
2. Command palette is opened and initial search items are displayed
3. First item in the list of initial search items is selected
2. User starts typing a search query.
3. User observes that the first search result matching the query is automatically selected in the results list in the palette
4. User presses the up or down arrow keys to navigate through the list of search results.
