# ppa03 User Story 3 Fuzzy Text Search

User Story 3:
As a user, I want the extension to perform fuzzy text searches, so that I can find interactive elements like buttons, input fields, links even when I make typos or only remember part of the text.

Acceptance Criteria:
- The search function matches partial text: all buttons, anchors, links and inputs on the page
- The search function is tolerant of minor spelling mistakes
- Search results are ranked by relevance
- The search is performed across all visible elements on the web page
