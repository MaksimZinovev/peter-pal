# User Story 5 Dynamic Highlighting

User Story 5:
As a user, I want selected search results to be visually highlighted on the web page, so that I can easily locate the matching elements.

Acceptance Criteria:
- The selected search result is highlighted on the web page.
- The highlighted element may be not in the current view (e.g. when page is long and element located at the bottom)
- The highlight effect is visually distinct (e.g., pulsating border, changed background color)
- The highlight effect is temporary and non-intrusive
- The highlight effect works on various element types (e.g., text, buttons, input fields)


User tasks:

1. User has the command palette open with search results displayed
2. User selects a search result item from the list using the keyboard or mouse
3. The corresponding element on the web page is persistently highlighted with a visually distinct effect (e.g., pulsating border, changed background color)
4. The highlight remains until the user selects a different search result or dismisses the command palette
